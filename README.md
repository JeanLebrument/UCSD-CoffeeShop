# UCSD-CoffeeShop
Final project for the class: "CSE-40635 Design Patterns" made in Java.

The purpose of this project was to implement design patterns of each category (creational, structural, behavioral).

This project is not about create a usable service but choose and implement design patterns in a context and make them work together.

For this project I used several design patterns:
- Facade: To abstract the inner working of the system.
- Singleton: Use only one instance of the Facade of the system. (The Singleton object doesn't retain any references of objects)
- Decorator: Use the Decorator design pattern to decorate a coffee beverage by adding options to it.
- Strategy: Use the Strategy design pattern to abstract the method of payment.
- Builder: Use the Builder design pattern to create a coffee beverage with a type of coffee and options to add.
- Abstract Factory: Use an Abstract Factory design pattern to abstract the creation of the desired method of payment.
